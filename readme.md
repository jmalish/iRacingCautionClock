# iRacing Caution Clock
This is the public repo of the iRacing Caution clock. It is meant to allow an easy place to download the program. The source code is in a private repo.

The program itself is meant to emulate the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series' "new" rules regarding cautions.

To connect to iRacing's SDK, I am using [Nick Thissens C# wrapper](https://github.com/NickThissen/iRacingSdkWrapper).  
I am also using yamldotnet to parse iRacing's SDK, which can be found in the nuget package manager.
